# 📖 About This Project

Welcome to the Shawar App – a wild, hilarious, and proudly chaotic slang-posting social media platform built purely for fun, culture, and creativity.

Shawar was born out of the shared madness of a tight-knit Bangladeshi friend group who wanted a place to share their unique slang, jokes, and roasts in their own lingo. It’s not just an app — it’s our inside joke gone digital.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to:
- Celebrate the weird and wonderful slang we use every day
- Build a community-driven mini-network of savage posts
- Learn and experiment with Dart, Firebase, and custom PHP APIs
- Have fun — that’s it. Just straight-up chaos and fun.
