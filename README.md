# 📖 About This Project

Welcome to the Shawar App – a wild, hilarious, and proudly chaotic slang-posting social media platform built purely for fun, culture, and creativity.

Shawar was born out of the shared madness of a tight-knit Bangladeshi friend group who wanted a place to share their unique slang, jokes, and roasts in their own lingo. It’s not just an app — it’s our inside joke gone digital.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to:
- Celebrate the weird and wonderful slang we use every day
- Build a community-driven mini-network of savage posts
- Learn and experiment with Dart, Firebase, and custom PHP APIs
- Have fun — that’s it. Just straight-up chaos and fun.

| Frontend      | Dart (Flutter for cross-platform UI)      |
| Backend       | Custom PHP REST API                       |
| Authentication| none for now 😆                            |
| Hosting/API   | Self-hosted on private server (Bangladesh)|
| Build Tools   | GitHub Actions (CI/CD to compile iOS app)  iam broke i dont have a pc 😭|
| Languages     | Bangla (including Gazipur Slang), English |

## 📦 Project Highlights

## 💬 Final Words

Shawar App is a playground for slang, expression, and sarcasm. It’s also a passion project that helped me grow my coding skills while giving my friends a space to laugh and post their weirdest phrases.

More features are on the way. Stay tuned to Shawar Shore for app drops and platform releases.
